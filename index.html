<p>I am currently an Information Sciences major with a focus in UX at Michigan State University. Growing up, I always wanted to create and make products more efficient for people. I have always had leadership skills since Junior High and have gotten praised by professors for my research skills. Since I have always had a keen interest in technology, my dream is to be able to become a UX Researcher for an app development company. I will be finishing my Bachelor's in May 2024 and pursueing my Master's of Science through MSU's UX Master's Program. </p>
